/**

 * Problem: Please implement a function which gets the minimal number of coins, whose value
 * is v1, v2, â€¦, vn, to make change for an amount of money with value t. Any coin with value
 * vi may duplicate for any times to make change.
 *
 * For example, the minimal number of coins to make change for 15 out of a set of coins with
 * value 1, 3, 9, 10 is 3. We can choose two coins with value 3 and a coin with value 9. The
 * number of coins for other choices should be greater than 3.
