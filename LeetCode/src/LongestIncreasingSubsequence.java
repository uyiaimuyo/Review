/**
 * Created by Aysar on 12/7/2014.
 * The longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the
 * longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence
 * are sorted in increasing order. For example, length of LIS for
 * { 10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80 } is 6
 * and LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.
