/* Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which 
* returns node at the begin- ning of the loop
* 
* DEFINITION
* Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a
* nodeâ€™s next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list
*
* EXAMPLE
* input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
* output: C
* 
* 1 approach: have 2 pointers, 1 outer pointer iterates thru each element
* inner pointer goes ahead and iterates thru entire list check for matching element
* this is o(n^2) complexity, o(1) space
*
* 2nd approach:
* iterate thru list, and have a hashset that contains nodes seen so far
* for each element, check if exists in hash 
* o(n) time, o(n) space
*
* 3rd approach:
* o(n) time, constant space use pointers
* have 2 pointers, 1 (n1) goes 1 step at a time, the other (n2) goes 2 steps at a time 
* first find the meeting point at which they'll both be
* then start n1 back at head, and keep n2 at meeting pointer
* start both of them one step at a time.  the next time they meet
* will be the start of the circular linked list
*
