1. Write a method to find the number of employees in each department
select count(*) from employees e group by e.department_id

2. What are the different types of joins? Please explain how they differ and why certain types are better in certain situations
Joins are used to combine the results of 2 tables.
inner join -> get intersection between a and b
select * from users u join posts p on u.id = p.user_id

outer join -> matches on matching col of a and b, includes non matched records
-> left  -> returns a and intersection
-> right -> returns b and intersection
-> full -> returns a, b and intersection

3. What is denormalization? Explain the pros and cons
Denormalization is the idea of increasing data redundancy for large scale databases whereby limiting the amount
of joins between tables due to their costliness.

pro: faster queries on single tables, data is available in more tables
con: complex queries that involve multiple tables are costly, indexing is costling, larger less clean/OO tables

4. Draw an entity-relationship diagram for a database with companies, people, and pro- fessionals (people who work for companies)

COMPANIES, company has many PEOPLE

PEOPLE composed of people and PROFESSIONALS
profesionals belong to 1 company

5. Imagine a simple database storing information for studentsâ€™ grades Design what this database might look like, and provide a SQL query to return a list of the honor roll students (top 10%), sorted by their grade point average

Grades
id, student_id, course_id, grade
1, 23, 34, 90
1, 23, 35, 78


select name, avg_grade from (select top 10 percent avg(grade) from grades group by student_id order by avg_grade desc)
join Students on Students.id = Grades.student_id
